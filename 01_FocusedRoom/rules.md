I am pretty comfortable with the UI right now.

Now we will work on fixing the internal working and the functionality and make sure the values are available in the UI placeholders as intended. We'll only make changes in the ui scripts if necessary after consulting me. I dont want the ui to change anymore.

I tested the application by trying to access 19 blocked websites and all of them were blocked. After that I stopped the session. The score given was (19*5) + (-15) = -110 which is correct. So dont touch the scoring and blocking logic.
