## üìã YOUR REVIEW CHECKLIST

### **Step 1: Preview the Email Designs** üëÅÔ∏è

The email previews are already generated and waiting for you:

```bash
# Location: email_previews/
01_welcome_vision.html         # Welcome + Vision email
02_big_five_report.html        # Big Five personality report
```

**‚úÖ ACTION REQUIRED:**
1. Open both HTML files in your browser
2. Review the design, content, and formatting
3. Check on both desktop and mobile view (resize browser)
4. Verify:
   - Professional appearance
   - No typos
   - Links work (they'll go to focusedroom.com)
   - Brand colors look good
   - Content matches your vision

### **Step 2: Send Test Emails to Yourself** üì®

```bash
# Send to souvik312@gmail.com (or any email you choose)
cd /Users/souvikganguly/Developer/AI/Extensive\ Agentic\ AI/02_FocusedRoom_website

python test_send_emails.py --email souvik312@gmail.com
```

**What this does:**
- Sends Email #1 (Welcome + Vision) to souvik312@gmail.com

1. Run the command above
2. Check your `souvik312@gmail.com` inbox (and spam folder)

python send_to_production_users.py --dry-run

# Then, REAL PRODUCTION RUN (requires typing "SEND NOW")
python send_to_production_users.py
```

**What this does:**
- Connects to your Render production database
- Gets all 20-21 subscribers
- Sends Email #1 (Welcome + Vision) to ALL subscribers
- Sends Email #2 (Big Five Report) to those who took the test
- Shows progress and results

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:**
