6. ‚úÖ **Project Setup** - React Native 0.72, TypeScript, folder structure

### Your Code Location
- **Path**: `/Users/souvikganguly/Developer/AI/Extensive Agentic AI/03_FocusedRoom_app/`
- **All PRDs**: PRD.md, PRD_PART2.md, PRD_PART3.md, PRD_PART4.md, PRD_COMMUNITY_FEATURES.md
- **All Source Code**: `src/` folder with theme, components, navigation, screens
- **iOS/Android**: Native folders ready (ios/, android/)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CURRENT ISSUE

**Problem**: React Native 0.72 (June 2023) is incompatible with your modern Android SDK (2024).

**Symptoms**:
- Android build fails with "requires SDK 34, but project uses SDK 33"
- Gradle/Kotlin version conflicts
- Dependencies (androidx) require newer versions

**Why This Happens**:
- You have latest Xcode, Android Studio, Java (all 2024 versions)
- React Native 0.72 was built for 2023 toolchains
- Modern Android dependencies need SDK 34+, but RN 0.72 only supports SDK 33

---

## üéØ WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE (Next Session)

### Option 1: Upgrade to React Native 0.76 (RECOMMENDED)
**Why**: Latest stable (Oct 2024), fully compatible with your tools
**Steps**:
1. Create new RN 0.76 project
2. Copy all your code (it's all TypeScript/React, will work as-is)
3. Install dependencies
4. Test on both iOS and Android

**Time**: ~30 minutes  
**Risk**: Low (your code is clean, will migrate easily)

### Option 2: Downgrade Your Android SDK
**Why**: Make tools match RN 0.72
**Steps**:
1. Install older Android SDK 33 in Android Studio
2. Install older build tools
3. Potentially downgrade Gradle

**Time**: ~45 minutes  
**Risk**: Medium (may cause other issues, not future-proof)

## üì¶ CLEANED UP

**Removed** (to save space, can reinstall anytime):
- `node_modules/` (1.5GB)
- `ios/Pods/` (500MB)
- `ios/build/` (build artifacts)
- `android/build/` (build artifacts)
- `android/.gradle/` (Gradle cache)

**To reinstall when needed**:
```bash
cd "/Users/souvikganguly/Developer/AI/Extensive Agentic AI/03_FocusedRoom_app"
npm install
cd ios && pod install
```

---

## üí§ SLEEP WELL!

**Tomorrow we will**:
1. Upgrade to React Native 0.76 (30 min)
2. Test on Android emulator (10 min)
3. Test on iOS simulator (10 min)
4. Start Phase 2: Authentication screens

**Your work is SAFE**. All code, PRDs, and structure are preserved.

---

## üìÅ File Counts
- **PRD Documents**: 5 files
- **Source Files**: 15+ TypeScript files
- **Components**: 4 reusable components
- **Screens**: 5 main screens
- **Theme Files**: 6 theme modules

**Everything is exactly as you built it.**
