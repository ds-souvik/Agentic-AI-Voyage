## üöÄ NEXT STEPS (Choose Your Path)

### Path A: START BUILDING NOW ‚ö°

**Time Required**: 30 minutes to get started

1. **Read the Summary** (5 min)
   ```bash
   open 03_FocusedRoom_app/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
   ```

2. **Review the PRD** (15 min - skim)
   - Focus on Section 11 in PRD_PART4.md: "Summary: What Will Be Built"
   - This gives you the complete picture

3. **Set Up Environment** (10 min)
   - Install Node.js 18+ (if not installed)
   - Install React Native CLI: `npm install -g react-native-cli`
   - Install Xcode (macOS) or Android Studio

4. **Start Phase 1** (Start tomorrow)
   - Open `TASKS.md`
   - Begin with **Phase 1, Task 1.1**: Development Environment Setup
   - Follow step-by-step

---

### Path B: SUBMIT TO LLM FOR REVIEW ü§ñ

**Recommended LLM**: Google Gemini 1.5 Pro (2M context window)

**Why Gemini 1.5 Pro?**
- 2M token context (can handle all 4 PRD parts at once)
- Already integrated in your website (Gemini Flash)
- Best for multimodal understanding (text + images + code)
- Excellent for product/technical review

**Prompt to Use:**

```
I'm building the Focused Room Mobile App - a revolutionary productivity app for iOS and Android.

I have a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) split into 4 parts, plus detailed task breakdown and development rules.

Please review the PRD and provide:
1. Feedback on completeness (any gaps?)
2. Technical feasibility assessment
3. Suggestions for improvement
4. Clarifying questions
5. Risk assessment (what could go wrong?)

Here's the PRD:

[Paste PRD.md content]
[Paste PRD_PART2.md content]
[Paste PRD_PART3.md content]
[Paste PRD_PART4.md content]

Also consider:
- TASKS.md: Development breakdown
- .cursorrules: Development standards
```

**What You'll Get:**
- Expert validation of your PRD
- Identification of gaps or risks
- Technical recommendations
- Prioritization suggestions

---

### Path C: USE CURSOR AGENT MODE ü§ñ

**Most Powerful Option**: Let Cursor AI build the app following your PRD and rules.

**Setup:**
1. **Open Cursor** in `03_FocusedRoom_app/` directory
2. **Enable Agent Mode** (Cmd+Shift+P ‚Üí "Enable Agent Mode")
3. **Point to .cursorrules** (Cursor will auto-detect it)
4. **Start with a task**:
   ```
   "Please complete Task 1.1 from TASKS.md: Development Environment Setup.
   Follow .cursorrules exactly."
   ```

**Cursor will:**
- Read PRD, TASKS.md, .cursorrules
- Act as expert Product Owner, UX Designer, and Developer
- Follow design system exactly
- Write high-quality TypeScript + React Native code
- Test thoroughly
- Explain what it's doing

**Example Workflow:**
```
You: "Complete Task 1.2: Project Initialization"

Cursor: "I'll initialize the React Native project with TypeScript.
Here's my plan:
1. Run npx react-native init FocusedRoom
2. Install dependencies (Redux, React Navigation, etc.)
3. Set up folder structure per FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md
4. Configure ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript
5. Test that project builds

Proceeding..."

[Cursor executes all steps]

Cursor: "‚úÖ Task 1.2 Complete. Project initialized successfully.
Next task: 1.3 Design System Implementation"
```

- [ ] Plan Week 2 (Authentication)

---

**Week 2-12: Development**

Follow TASKS.md sequentially:
- Week 2: Authentication
- Weeks 3-4: App Blocking
- Weeks 5-6: Deep Work Sessions
- Week 7: Gamification
- Week 8: Reports
- Week 9: Sync
- Week 10: Settings
- Week 11: Testing
- Week 12: Launch Prep

---

## üéì KEY DOCUMENTS EXPLAINED

### 1. PRD (Product Requirements Document)
**What**: Complete specification of what to build  
**When to read**: Before starting any feature  
**How to use**: Reference when implementing features

**Structure**:
- **Part 1**: Features A-D (Blocking, Friction, Sessions, Gamification)
- **Part 2**: Features E-I (Personalization, Reports, Sync, Settings, Blog)
- **Part 3**: UX/UI, Design System, Technical Requirements
- **Part 4**: Monetization, Metrics, Rollout, Summary

---

### 2. TASKS.md
**What**: 160+ tasks broken into 10 phases  
**When to read**: Daily (to know what to build today)  
**How to use**: Follow sequentially, check off as you complete

**Structure**:
- 10 Phases (Project Setup ‚Üí Launch Prep)
- Each phase has 10-20 tasks
- Each task has subtasks, estimates, acceptance criteria

**Example Task**:
```
Task 3.2.4: Implement blocking overlay (Android)
Priority: P0
Time: 2 hours
Subtasks:
  - Create BlockingOverlayActivity.kt
  - Design full-screen overlay UI
  - Show session timer and friction button
  - Handle back button (prevent exit)
Acceptance Criteria:
  - Overlay shows when blocked app is opened
  - Timer displays correctly
  - Friction button navigates to challenge
```

---

### 3. .cursorrules
**What**: Comprehensive rules for Cursor AI agent  
**When to read**: Once before starting, reference when coding  
**How to use**: Cursor auto-reads it, you ensure compliance

**Contains**:
- Design system (colors, typography, spacing)
- Code quality standards (TypeScript, React Native)
- Gamification rules (exact scoring logic)
- Security rules (no hardcoded secrets)
- Testing requirements (>80% coverage)
- Red flags (12 things to never do)
- Green flags (10 things to always do)

---

### 4. FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md
**What**: React Native project organization  
**When to read**: When creating new files  
**How to use**: Know where to put new components/screens

**Example**:
- New reusable button? ‚Üí `src/components/common/Button.tsx`
- New screen? ‚Üí `src/screens/[feature]/[ScreenName].tsx`
- New API endpoint? ‚Üí `src/api/endpoints/[feature].ts`
- Business logic? ‚Üí `src/services/[featureName]Service.ts`

---

## üí° PRO TIPS

### Tip 1: Read PRD Strategically
**Don't read linearly.** Jump to what you need:
- Building blocking feature? ‚Üí Read PRD.md Section 4.A
- Building gamification? ‚Üí Read PRD.md Section 4.D
- Designing UI? ‚Üí Read PRD_PART3.md Section 5

### Tip 2: Use Cursor Agent Mode Effectively
**Break tasks into small steps:**
```
Bad: "Build the entire session feature"
Good: "Implement startSession() function in sessionService.ts per PRD Section 4.C.1"
```

### Tip 3: Reference Chrome Extension Code
**When implementing gamification:**
```bash
cd ../01_FocusedRoom/src/core/gamification.js
# Read this file to understand EXACT scoring logic
# Then implement in mobile app
```

### Tip 4: Test on Physical Devices Early
- iOS Screen Time API: Doesn't work on simulator
- Android AccessibilityService: Works on emulator but test on device
- **Get physical devices by Week 3**

### Tip 5: Don't Skip Testing
Every task in TASKS.md has "Acceptance Criteria":
```
Acceptance Criteria:
  - [ ] Can start a session with custom duration
  - [ ] Timer counts down correctly
  - [ ] Session persists if app is closed
```

**Check ALL boxes before marking task complete.**

## üö® COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

### ‚ùå Pitfall 1: Changing Gamification Rules
**DON'T**: "Let's make sessions 20 minutes instead of 25"  
**DO**: Follow PRD exactly (25-minute minimum for valid sessions)

### ‚ùå Pitfall 2: Deviating from Design System
**DON'T**: Use #0000FF for buttons  
**DO**: Use exact color from .cursorrules: `#7A9E9F`

### ‚ùå Pitfall 3: Skipping Tasks
**DON'T**: Jump to Phase 5 (Gamification) without doing Phase 3 (Blocking)  
**DO**: Follow TASKS.md sequentially (dependencies matter)

### ‚ùå Pitfall 4: No Testing
**DON'T**: "It works on my iPhone, ship it"  
**DO**: Test on iOS simulator, Android emulator, AND physical devices

### ‚ùå Pitfall 5: Ignoring .cursorrules
**DON'T**: Use `any` type in TypeScript  
**DO**: Define proper interfaces (rule in .cursorrules)

## üìû NEED HELP?

### Questions About the PRD?
- Check PROJECT_SUMMARY.md Section "Questions or Clarifications?"
- Re-read relevant PRD section
- Ask specific questions (not "explain everything")

### Stuck on a Task?
- Re-read task description in TASKS.md
- Check .cursorrules for guidance
- Break task into smaller steps
- Ask Cursor AI in Agent mode

### Technical Blockers?
- iOS Screen Time not working? ‚Üí Must use physical device
- Android blocking not working? ‚Üí Check AccessibilityService permissions
- Sync not working? ‚Üí Verify WebSocket connection
