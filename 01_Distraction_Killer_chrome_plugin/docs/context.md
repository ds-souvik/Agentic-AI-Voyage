Context: I have enrolled in a program called Extensive Agentic AI V2 by The School of AI. Today was day 1 of the course. Homework given is to build a chrome plugin which will be useful to me and others as well. The person with the best and most useful idea with excellent and professional execution will be rewarded the most points. I've come up with the below chrome plugin idea: Distraction Killer: I want to make a chrome plugin that will help me focus while I’m working by blocking all the distracting websites. 1. I want to be able to schedule a deep work focus time and during that time, the plugin should disable all the social media websites, porn websites, e-commerce websites and news website. These sites will be auto decoded by the plugin. 2. Whenever I try to open such distracting websites, I shouldn’t be allowed to access them and redirect to a page mentioning a webpage with an image, a timer showing how much time is left before the deep work session ends and text of my choice. 3. Along with that I should also be given a choice to access the page if I still want to go ahead and access it but as a friction I will have to type a paragraph that will shame me to do so. 4. The UI/ UX of the plugin and the redirected page once I click on distracting website should be sophisticated. 5. It should have an option for me to download the deep work report of the day and deep work report of the week. I know very basics of python and SQL coding. I want to use a coding platform like cursor to help me do this. Before beginning with the code, I want to make a plan. Can you help me come up with the plan and teach me the basics of what I need to know before I continue. Also tell me what are the functions that I can further add from the plugin or need to drop from the plugin.

ChatGPT gave a detailed answer.

Context: As per your suggestion, I’ve worked on the Phase 0 - thinking & design and Phase 1 - MVP of the chrome plugin. Name of the plugin: DistractionKiller

1. Exact user flow: 
    * User sits to work on the desk.
    * User schedules “Deep Work Time”
    * As soon as the scheduled time starts, the Auto block activates.
    * While working if user has the urge to access any blocked website in another tab, the Plugin blocks it. Then the user is redirected to a web page that has an image I’ve designed with a quote.
        - After getting blocked to use the blocked website and seeing the redirected webpage, the user will either close that website altogether or he might still want to access the blocked website. If the user wants to access the blocked website, there’ll be a friction. He will have to choose the time from drop down of 5, 15 or 30 minutes and then will have to read a paragraph on the screen and write it on a textbox on the screen. The user can’t copy/ paste that paragraph. This is the paragraph “I’m about to waste precious time on this site instead of working toward my goals. Every minute spent here is a minute I could’ve used to learn something new, finish a task, or make progress on what truly matters. I know I’m capable of better choices—why am I letting distractions win?” After writing this paragraph, the user will click on access website button to go to the blocked website.
    * While working if user has the urge to unblock the blocker altogether, he will have to stop the “Deep Work Time”. 
        - If the user clicks on that button, user will be redirected to a page that shows the remaining time to finish the “Deep Work Time”. If the user still chooses to stop the “Deep Work Time”, he will have to read a paragraph on the screen and write it on a textbox on the screen. The user can’t copy/ paste that paragraph. This is the paragraph “I’m about to waste precious time on this site instead of working toward my goals. Every minute spent here is a minute I could’ve used to learn something new, finish a task, or make progress on what truly matters. I know I’m capable of better choices—why am I letting distractions win?”
    *  The user can also extract the daily Depp Work Report and Weekly Deep Work Report.

2. Blocked websites: I want to have a list of exhaustive distracting websites that can be blocked. Which websites to block?
    * Hardcoded list of porn, social media, e-commerce and news websites:
